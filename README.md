# programming-languages
This is list of programming languages I have made for learning. In each project there were many key takeaways that can be learned from. I will continue to add information and lessons learned from each project. I will also add a description of each project and what it accomplished.

# mahou [[source](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/mahou)]
Mahou is my AP Computer Science create task for the 2020-21 year. Mahou is a source-to-source compiler, from a custom language to python.
Mahou uses a lexer to find all of the tokens in the original source, then uses a parser to convert the source code into python.
